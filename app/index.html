    <p>I love sugar. I can literally eat just about any candy or dessert. Though sugar is very unhealthy it is very addictive.
      My favorites are brownies, chocolate covered strawberries, and cotton candy. They are a guilty pleasure that I have
      to stay away from unless it is my birthday!</p>
